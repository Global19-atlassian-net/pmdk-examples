### Introduction

The goal of this repository is to present clear programming examples of how to
use the C++ and Java bindings of libpmemobj, which is a core library of the
Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK).

### Build Instructions

For compilation, a Makefile is provided.  To build all samples, including PMDK 
and PCJ, just type `make`. The following are the needed dependencies:

 - A C++ compiler. The default C++ compiler used is `g++`. You can change that
   by setting the `CXX` variable in `common.mk`.
 - Java 8 or above (including a Java compiler). The `$JAVA_HOME` environmental
   variable needs to be propertly set.
 - The [Boost C++ Library Collection](http://boost.org), used by some samples.
 - To build PMDK you may need to install other dependencies in your system.
   Please, read the instructions in the 
   [PMDK repository](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk).

The build process will compile and use the latest master branch version of
PMDK and PCJ. If you want to use a custom installed version of PMDK, you can 
change the `PMDK_EXAMPLES_INCLUDE` and `PMDK_EXAMPLES_LIB_NONDEBUG` variables 
in `common.mk` appropriately.

Alternatively, you can build single samples by typing `make <sample_name>`. For
example: 

	$ make mapreduce 

Or go to the directory of that particular sample and running make:

	$ cd mapreduce
	$ make

In order for this to work, you need to have the PMDK libraries built first.
If you are using the PMDK provided with these examples, you can build them
by running:

	$ make library

For more information, please read the READMEs for each sample.

### Run Instructions

If you are not using a custom installed PMDK, add the library path to your 
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable before running any sample code:

	$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/pmdk/src/nondebug:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
